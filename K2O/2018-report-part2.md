# Technical Analysis

## Course

The race organizators provide a GPX file with the recommended course. It mostly follows the navigational channel. There were some areas on 
- GPS track not always reliable because of weed
- some short cuts taken by locals
- couldn't find the entry to the mud cut
- swirveled my way on Newboro Lake

## Timing


### Paddling

### Locks

- spent 3 hours 40 minutes portaging the locks which includes replenishing food, water and bathroom stops

# Preparation

## Training

I finished the K 1/2 O in 2016. This year I was ready to go the full distance.

Starting in the Fall I prepare for some half marathon races in the early Spring. I usually participate in the Chilly Halfmarathon in Burlington, ON on the first Sunday in March.

I started paddling this Spring as soon as the Grand River was safe end of March. I was on the water on 36 days before the K2O. I paddled The Dam Hespeler Race in April (20km) and the Big East River X Race in May (40km).
I also organized and paddled the 3rd edition of the "EPIC Paddle" from Elora Gorge to Paris, ON on the Grand River. This is an open event hosted by our Waterloo Wellington Canoe and Kayak Club of which I'm a member. This covers a distance of about 95 km slow moving downstream. This year it took us about 14 hours from 6am to 8pm.

Then I paddled 65 km in 10 hours overnight from Wilsons Flat to Cambridge, ON to test my night equipment and to learn about myself paddling alone in the dark.

Overall I logged 770 km since March.



## Food, Hydration

From experiences in 2016 I knew that I wouldn't be very hungry during the race. I prepared "energy balls" from a mix of dates, oatmeal and beet root juice. I also had several 150g bars of marsipan, Clif Bars and LÃ¶rabars. My wife bought cookies at Starbucks and Apple Fritter at Tim Hortons during the race.

I eat one cookie, the apple fritter, two of the marsipan bars. I forced myself to eat one energy ball at least every 2 hours.

I drank water, coffee, apple juice, coca cola. I have a hydration bladder on the back of my PFD and a [4l MSR Dromedary](https://www.msrgear.com/water/water-storage/dromedary-bags) in the kayak during the long leg to Poonamalie and the _Long Reach_. Throughout the race I probably drank 1.5l coffee, 1l apple juice, 2 cans of coke, 4-5l water.

I had problems with heartburn. I'll need to bring Tums or something similar if I'm going to do this again.

## Logistics

For the navigation I relied primarily on the GPS and the Atlas from [TrakMap](https://www.trakmaps.com/en/products/printed/details/rideau-canal-kingston-ottawa-614/). [Navigational Charts](http://www.charts.gc.ca/documents/charts-cartes/manitoba-index.pdf) from Fisheries and Oceans Canada, #1512 and #1513 are available from certified printer, eg. [World of Maps in Ottawa](http://worldofmaps.com/) on Wellington St W and Parkdale Ave.
Those are helpful in the preparation at home. I looked at them on those long and cold Winter nights.

I downloaded charts for the GPS from [OpenStreetMap](http://garmin.openstreetmap.nl). I used Garmin Basecamp to create all lock stations as waypoints. I didn't use directly the GPX track provided by the race organizers. Instead I created a route from the track. To learn more about the differences between tracks and routes visit the [Garmin website](https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=v0rJAHy2hq3prHjRlxdRw5&searchType=noProduct).


## Shore Crew

Every racer needs a shore crew. You need the best crew you can assemble. I had the best crew _in da world_ :-). My wife, my brother-in-law and one of my wife's nephews helped me along the way. I cannot overstate how important those helpers are. They keep your spirits up, the help you with the portages, they replenish your food and drinks and they will be successful with you. You also don't want to disappoint them! These thoughts help you in your weaks moments.

## Equipment

### Boat

2016 I paddled the race in my Wilderness System Tempest 170PRO. Back then I noticed how many other racers had EPICs. I decided that if I'd ever come back for the full distance I'd need one too.

I setup an alert on Kijiji. Lo and behold an ad showed up in the Fall of 2016 and I was able to buy a - barely - used boat. I'm now paddling an [EPIC 18X Sport](https://www.epickayaks.com/18x-sport) model 2012. It's the same boat in which Freya Hoffmeister cirumnavigated Australia and two thirds of South America. That should be enough for me.

My paddle is an [EPIC mid wing full carbon paddle](https://www.epickayaks.com/mid-wing-paddle), size 210-220cm from [Kayaksport Canada](http://www.kayaksport.net/) (thank you Dav!). My spare is a [Werner Cyprus](http://wernerpaddles.com/paddles/high-angle/cyprus) (220cm) from [Adventure Guide in Waterloo](http://advguide.com/).

### Mandatory safety equipment

I'm using the following safety equipment:

- [Mocke PFD](https://mockepaddling.com/product/mocke-racer-pfd/) with built-in 1.5l hydration bladder
- Whistle
- [NRS Paddle Float](https://www.nrs.com/product/1598/nrs-sea-kayak-paddle-float)
- 50 feet throw line
- [Scotty pump](https://www.mec.ca/en/product/4007-257/Pump-13-5%22-with-Float)

### Other Equipment

My GPS is a [Garmin eTrex 20x](https://www.gpscity.ca/garmin-etrex-20x).
I got the sun and moon times from the [US Navy](http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/RS_OneYear.php).

The lights are [Black Diamond Spot](https://www.blackdiamondequipment.com/en_CA/headlamps-and-lanterns/spot-BD620634_cfg.html) and [Gemini Duo](https://gemini-lights.com/products/duo) with 4-cell battery.
