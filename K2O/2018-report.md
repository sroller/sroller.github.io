## Food

## Logistics

Atlas from [TrakMap](https://www.trakmaps.com/en/products/printed/details/rideau-canal-kingston-ottawa-614/)
[Navigational Charts](http://www.charts.gc.ca/documents/charts-cartes/manitoba-index.pdf) from Fisheries and Oceans Canada, #1512 and #1513. Those are only available from certified printer, eg. [World of Maps in Ottawa](http://worldofmaps.com/) on Wellington St W and Parkdale Ave.

I downloaded charts for the GPS from [OpenStreetMap](http://garmin.openstreetmap.nl). I used Garmin Basecamp to create all lock stations as waypoints. I didn't use directly the GPX track provided by the race organizers. Instead I created a route from the track. I highly recommend this procedure. You can learn more about the differences between tracks and routes at the [Garmin website](https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=v0rJAHy2hq3prHjRlxdRw5&searchType=noProduct).

### Poonamalie to Buritts Rapids

- Navigation at night
- GPS, Charts, Stars

- extra portage in Burritts Rapids Lock at pedestrian bridge

### The Long Reach (40km)

- I left Burritts Rapids Lock at dawn. The river was still like a mirror. All that changed just before sunrise.
- The wind started at 5:30am, according to Environment Canada >30 km/h, gusts felt stronger, came from Northeast, difficult to find protection

- rain started about two hours later at 7:30am
- speed stopped dramatically with the wind
- I started to calculate whether I could still make it within the cutoff times
- I considered to call my shore crew for an early extraction
- I stopped multiple times (6x) for several minutes to eat and to rest. I was at the end of my abilities.

### The Rest (16km)
