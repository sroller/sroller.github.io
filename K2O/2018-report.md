# K2O - Kingston to Ottawa

Ontario's longest marathon paddle race

# What's the story?

For me, the [K2O](http://kingston2ottawa.ca) is an iconic race. It takes place on the [Rideau Waterway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rideau_Canal) which is managed by Parks Canada and a designated UNESCO World Heritage Site. It connects the old capital Kingston with current capital Ottawa.

## The Route

The race starts from the Cataraqui Canoe Club in Kingston. First the paddlers have to go out to Lake Ontario before they turn around and come back into the sheltered waters of the Cataraqui River. The route leads North towards the Kingston Mills Lockstation, continues through Colonel By Lake into the River Styx to the Lower Brewers. Cranberry Lake follows the Upper Brewers. At the end of Whitefish Lake lies Jones Falls Lock. The waterway winds through the landscape to Sand Lake, Opinicon Lake, Indian Lake, Clear Lake and finally into Newboro Lake, the first bigger lake.
The Newboro Lockstation is the highest point on the way to Ottawa. After the lock is passed the way leads through the Upper Rideau Lake to Rideau Narrows.

The Narrows are the 8th portage of the race. The next leg is the second longest of the race. The paddlers will navigate through the Big Rideau and the Lower Rideau Lake to finally arrive in Poonamalie after more than 30 km.

## Food

## Logistics

Atlas from [TrakMap](https://www.trakmaps.com/en/products/printed/details/rideau-canal-kingston-ottawa-614/)
[Navigational Charts](http://www.charts.gc.ca/documents/charts-cartes/manitoba-index.pdf) from Fisheries and Oceans Canada, #1512 and #1513. Those are only available from certified printer, eg. [World of Maps in Ottawa](http://worldofmaps.com/) on Wellington St W and Parkdale Ave.

I downloaded charts for the GPS from [OpenStreetMap](http://garmin.openstreetmap.nl). I used Garmin Basecamp to create all lock stations as waypoints. I didn't use directly the GPX track provided by the race organizers. Instead I created a route from the track. I highly recommend this procedure. You can learn more about the differences between tracks and routes at the [Garmin website](https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=v0rJAHy2hq3prHjRlxdRw5&searchType=noProduct).
