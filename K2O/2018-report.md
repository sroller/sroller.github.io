# What's the story?

For me, the [K2O](http://kingston2ottawa.ca) is an iconic race. It takes place on the [Rideau Waterway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rideau_Canal) which is managed by Parks Canada and a designated UNESCO World Heritage Site. It connects the old capital Kingston with current capital Ottawa.

For those who want to explore the area there are good online resources available, eg. [Watson's Paddling Guide to the Rideau Canal](http://www.rideau-info.com/canal/paddling/guides.html). It's said that the tour from Ottawa to Kingston or vice versa is a good weeklong trip.

## The Route

The race starts from the Cataraqui Canoe Club in Kingston. First the paddlers have to go out to Lake Ontario before they turn around and come back into the sheltered waters of the Cataraqui River. The route leads North towards the Kingston Mills Lockstation, continues through Colonel By Lake into the River Styx to the Lower Brewers. Cranberry Lake follows the Upper Brewers. At the end of Whitefish Lake lies Jones Falls Lock. The waterway winds through the landscape to Sand Lake, Opinicon Lake, Indian Lake, Clear Lake and finally into Newboro Lake, the first bigger lake.
The Newboro Lockstation is the highest point on the way to Ottawa. After the lock is passed the way leads through the Upper Rideau Lake to Rideau Narrows.

The Narrows are the 8th portage of the race. The next leg is the second longest of the race. The paddlers will navigate through the Big Rideau and the Lower Rideau Lake to finally arrive in Poonamalie after more than 30 km.

The racer have to portage 11 locks over the next 35 km. When they leave the last one which Burritts Rapids Lock #17 then the _Long Reach_ begins. This extends more than 40 km and is the longest leg of the race.

The paddlers will see the Long Island after 35 km. But the name was givin for a reason. Another five kilometers have to be paddled before the lock finally appears.

The paddlers who made it to this place have already more than 180 km behind them. The remaining 14 km are a piece of cake. The last portage at the Black Rapids Lock #13 is a short 165 m. From here it's only 6 km until the racers cross the finishing line at the docks of the Rideau Canoe Club in Ottawa, close to Hog's Back.

My GPS showed 196 km at this place.

# Preparation

## Training

I finished the K 1/2 O in 2016. This year I was ready to go the full distance.

Starting in the Fall I prepare for some half marathon races in the early Spring. I usually participate in the Chilly Halfmarathon in Burlington, ON on the first Sunday in March.

I started paddling this Spring as soon as the Grand River was safe end of March. I was on the water on 36 days before the K2O. I paddled The Dam Hespeler Race in April (20km) and the Big East River X Race in May (40km).
I also organized and paddled the 3rd edition of the "EPIC Paddle" from Elora Gorge to Paris, ON on the Grand River. This is an open event hosted by our Waterloo Wellington Canoe and Kayak Club of which I'm a member. This covers a distance of about 95 km slow moving downstream. This year it took us about 14 hours from 6am to 8pm.

Then I paddled 65 km in 10 hours overnight from Wilsons Flat to Cambridge, ON to test my night equipment and to learn about myself paddling alone in the dark.

Overall I logged 770 km since March.



## Food, Hydration

From experiences in 2016 I knew that I wouldn't be very hungry during the race. I prepared "energy balls" from a mix of dates, oatmeal and beet root juice. I also had several 150g bars of marsipan, Clif Bars and Lörabars. My wife bought cookies at Starbucks and Apple Fritter at Tim Hortons during the race.

I eat one cookie, the apple fritter, two of the marsipan bars. I forced myself to eat one energy ball at least every 2 hours.

I drank water, coffee, apple juice, coca cola. I have a hydration bladder on the back of my PFD and a [4l MSR Dromedary](https://www.msrgear.com/water/water-storage/dromedary-bags) in the kayak during the long leg to Poonamalie and the _Long Reach_. Throughout the race I probably drank 1.5l coffee, 1l apple juice, 2 cans of coke, 4-5l water.

I had problems with heartburn. I'll need to bring Tums or something similar if I'm going to do this again.

## Logistics

For the navigation I relied primarily on the GPS and the Atlas from [TrakMap](https://www.trakmaps.com/en/products/printed/details/rideau-canal-kingston-ottawa-614/). [Navigational Charts](http://www.charts.gc.ca/documents/charts-cartes/manitoba-index.pdf) from Fisheries and Oceans Canada, #1512 and #1513 are available from certified printer, eg. [World of Maps in Ottawa](http://worldofmaps.com/) on Wellington St W and Parkdale Ave.
Those are helpful in the preparation at home. I looked at them on those long and cold Winter nights.

I downloaded charts for the GPS from [OpenStreetMap](http://garmin.openstreetmap.nl). I used Garmin Basecamp to create all lock stations as waypoints. I didn't use directly the GPX track provided by the race organizers. Instead I created a route from the track. To learn more about the differences between tracks and routes visit the [Garmin website](https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=v0rJAHy2hq3prHjRlxdRw5&searchType=noProduct).


## Shore Crew

Every racer needs a shore crew. You need the best crew you can assemble. I had the best crew _in da world_ :-). My wife, my brother-in-law and one of my wife's nephews helped me along the way. I cannot overstate how important those helpers are. They keep your spirits up, the help you with the portages, they replenish your food and drinks and they will be successful with you. You also don't want to disappoint them! These thoughts help you in your weaks moments.

## Equipment

### Boat

2016 I paddled the race in my Wilderness System Tempest 170PRO. Back then I noticed how many other racers had EPICs. I decided that if I'd ever come back for the full distance I'd need one too.

I setup an alert on Kijiji. Lo and behold an ad showed up in the Fall of 2016 and I was able to buy a - barely - used boat. I'm now paddling an [EPIC 18X Sport](https://www.epickayaks.com/18x-sport) model 2012. It's the same boat in which Freya Hoffmeister cirumnavigated Australia and two thirds of South America. That should be enough for me.

My paddle is an [EPIC mid wing full carbon paddle](https://www.epickayaks.com/mid-wing-paddle), size 210-220cm from [Kayaksport Canada](http://www.kayaksport.net/) (thank you Dav!). My spare is a [Werner Cyprus](http://wernerpaddles.com/paddles/high-angle/cyprus) (220cm) from [Adventure Guide in Waterloo](http://advguide.com/).

### Mandatory safety equipment

I'm using the following safety equipment:

- [Mocke PFD](https://mockepaddling.com/product/mocke-racer-pfd/) with built-in 1.5l hydration bladder
- Whistle
- [NRS Paddle Float](https://www.nrs.com/product/1598/nrs-sea-kayak-paddle-float)
- 50 feet throw line
- [Scotty pump](https://www.mec.ca/en/product/4007-257/Pump-13-5%22-with-Float)

### Other Equipment

My GPS is a [Garmin eTrex 20x](https://www.gpscity.ca/garmin-etrex-20x).
I got the sun and moon times from the [US Navy](http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/RS_OneYear.php).

The lights are [Black Diamond Spot](https://www.blackdiamondequipment.com/en_CA/headlamps-and-lanterns/spot-BD620634_cfg.html) and [Gemini Duo](https://gemini-lights.com/products/duo) with 4-cell battery.

I'm using a [portaging cart](https://www.mec.ca/en/product/5032-082/Mini-Tuff-Tire-Wheels).


# Race

## Travel

We live in Kitchener, ON. We took Friday off and drove to Kingston. I had booked a hotel room on Princess St, less than 15 min drive away from the start at the Cataraqui Canoe Club. We showed up for the checkin in the afternoon. I had a good chat with the folks from [Infinite Blue](https://infiniteblue.blue/). My wife bought me paddle shorts for my birthday in September which I wore for the race. I stored my boat at the club - thank you to the club members for the permission. Then we went for dinner in downtown Kingston.
